<h2>Dataset</h2>

DermAInsight leverages the SCIN Dataset from Google Research.
The SCIN dataset, developed in collaboration with physicians at [(https://med.stanford.edu/)](https://med.stanford.edu/), includes over 10,000 images of skin, nail, and hair conditions. Designed to reflect the diverse range of concerns people search for online, it supplements typical clinical datasets. All contributions were made voluntarily through a Crowdsourcing Method, with informed consent, under an institutional review board-approved study in the US.
